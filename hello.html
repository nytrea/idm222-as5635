            <h4 class="introduction_paragraph">  I am a UI/UX Designer at the Westphal School of Design at Drexel University currently pursuing a major in UI/UX design and a minor in Computer Science. </h4>
                
            <h4 class="introduction_paragraph"> I've gone from drawing on my parents' walls at home to designing and painting murals for my local high school, so when I was majoring in Computer Science
               I knew that I was still on my path for finding my career fit.   
             </h4>

             <h4 class="introduction_paragraph">
                UI/UX design (while also practicing my programming skills) gives me the best of both worlds -- being able to impart my personal 
                designs to enhance the technology that people may use is vital to my aspirations.

                With the pockets of free time I get, one could find me drawing in my sketchbook, tending to my plants, or going out for a walk and exploring my campus. As I've found myself
                   having to spend more time indoors in the past two years, I've reconnected with my love for watching history documentaries and creating dishes that put a modern twist on my Malabar Coast heritage.
